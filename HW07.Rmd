1. Rename the data set `dat1`.


2. Each row of `dat1` represents data from a different participant. Add a participant `ID`
number column to the data set and call it `ID`.


3. Create `dat1_long` by pivoting `dat1` from wide to long. When you pivot, name the
new column that will hold the categorical values (Face, Circle, Newspaper, and White)
`target` and name the new column that will hold the numeric outcome data `gaze_time`.


4. Use `summarize()` and `group_by()` with `dat1_long` to find the sample mean for each
child for each target (Face, Circle, Newspaper, and White)


5. Use `ggplot()` with `dat_long` to create a conditional boxplot that has separate boxplots
of gaze time for each target (Face, Circle, Newspaper, and White)
