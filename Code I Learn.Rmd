## Introduction to R
### 1. Vectors 
```{r example}
v <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
```
If we want to change names, we can do: 
```{r} 
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
## Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]
poker_days <- poker_vector[c(2:4)]
poker_days
```
If we want to select some results for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
```{r}
poker_start <- poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday", "Wednesday")]
poker_start
```
We can have *logics* to see which day we make money
```{r}
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
selection_vector
```
And select from poker_vector these days
```{r} 
poker_winning_days <- poker_vector[selection_vector]
poker_winning_days
```

### 2. Matrix
