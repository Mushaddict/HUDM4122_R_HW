## Introduction to R
### Vectors 
```{r example}
v <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
```
If we want to change names, we can do: 
```{r} 
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
```
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {}

```
